### Description 
This script... 

...is the first few steps in modeling the behavior of a building-integrated solar cogeneration system in situ. 

...generates geometry of a building that collects as much sun as possible at it's envelope. 

...initiates energy modeling (via Honeybee). 

...provides analysis of simulation (in the works).

...generates output for more physical systems modeling in post-processing.
